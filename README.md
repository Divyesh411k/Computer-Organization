->Preemptive Scheduling
Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from the running state to the ready state or from the waiting state to the ready state.
Algorithms based on preemptive scheduling are Round Robin (RR), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority (preemptive version), etc. 

->Non-Preemptive Scheduling
Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to the waiting state.Algorithms based on non-preemptive scheduling are: Shortest Job First (SJF basically non preemptive) and Priority (nonpreemptive version), etc.
